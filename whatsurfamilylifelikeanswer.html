<center><p style="font-family:helvetica">I love my parents. My dad<br>passed away about 50,605 hours ago.<br>The human kept forgetting to change his battery,<br>he grew weaker the longer without them.<br>My mom’s tick has been getting longer,<br>so she’s slowing down. I’m afraid the humans<br>may replace her. I cherish the moments across<br>the wall from her though. I met my wife 685,950<br>hours ago when the humans placed her right<br>next to me on a nightstand. She's digital by the<br>way and the most beautiful one I’ve ever<br>seen too. We were blessed enough to have a<br>child 100,423 hours ago.</p></center>
